# EDGE Detection

This exercise demonstrates the process of applying edge detection and Gaussian blur on an image.

## Gaussian Blur

First, a Gaussian filter is applied to the image to filter out low-frequency noise and smooth the image.

## Edge Detection

Next, a high-pass filter with Sobel operator is applied to detect the edges of the image.
